# NodesOfTrees
This is a project for working with tree(N-ary Tree), where the parameter `parentId == null` indicates that the node is a root node. 
`Children`: A collection of `HashSet<TreeNode>`, representing the child nodes. Using HashSet ensures the uniqueness of the child nodes and prevents the addition of duplicates, as well as provides fast search of elements. 
Don't forget to change the `ConnectionStrings` in `appsettings.json`.
